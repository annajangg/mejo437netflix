                <h2>Application</h2>
                <p>I remember back when Squid Game was released. Everybody was talking about it, and everybody wanted to wear the costumes or play the games that were in the show. I remember being so happy that this K-drama was being talked about and that so many people were coming to me to ask for other K-drama recommendations (probably because I’m Korean...). Last year, every street vendor in Korea had Squid Game character merchandise. Let’s not forget about the Dalgonas. I never saw a Dalgona back when I lived in Korea, but now they are selling everywhere on the streets of Korea. I even saw them being sold at the Buddhist Temple we went to in Busan! Of course, they were only really being sold at places where there would be a greater number of tourists.</p>
                <p>Because Squid Game was so well received, I fully believe that the global audience became more interested and open to watching K-dramas, even with the language barrier. The dystopian story of Squid Game was very different from the typical K-dramas. When I was younger, K-dramas were typically about modern or Joseon Dynasty stories of romance, achieving goals, action, and occasionally some mild fantasy. After Squid Game, there have been so many fantasy K-dramas based in the future with robots, zombies, or even outer space. I read an article before about how the director of Squid Game almost gave up on the script because his story kept on being rejected for 10 years. Netflix is the one who decided to take the risk of creating the drama, and now the rest is history. Squid Game started the wave of new creative stories that broke through traditional norms. This was the power of Squid Game.</p>
                <p>Not only are Korean technology like Samsung or Hyundai globally known, K-pop and K-dramas are the reasons Korean media content is being recognized all over the world. Even Lee Jung-jae, the main character of Squid Game, is the main celebrity face behind the campaign to make Busan the host of the World Expo 2030. They are also used to encourage tourism. One of the exhibits at HiKR showed some  of the beautiful locations where a K-drama was filmed encouraging people to visit those places. I had also researched that quite a lot of variety shows and scenes from K-dramas were filmed in the Digital Media City. </p>

                <h2>Major Takeaway #1: Korean cafe culture is extensive.</h2>
                <p>As someone who lived in Korea and visited many times, I already knew that Korea had a considerable number of cafes. What I was surprised about was how much cafes are a part of Korean culture. </p>
                <p>In America, the main reason people go to cafes is to work on a laptop, read, study, or journal. In Korea, people go to cafes not only to study, but also to socialize. Koreans love to talk. But Koreans don’t hang out at each other’s houses as much as Americans, because Korean usually live in apartments and often with family so they can’t be too noisy and have to respect their surrounding people. That’s why Koreans go to cafes to meet up a lot more. It is the norm in Korea to just go to cafes for everything.</p>
                <p>As an American, going to cafes is not really the norm, it is more of a decision to go there to study or get coffee. However, while I was with my relatives, I was going to cafes just for the heck of it. In America, I would never meet up with people at cafes before heading to a restaurant for dinner, I would have just met up with them at the restaurant. I would never eat dinner and think “Oh, I want to go to a cafe now” and order dessert and coffee at 8pm at night even though we were all stuffed from eating too much at dinner. I guess experiencing first-hand how ingrained it is for Koreans to want to go to a cafe is why cafe culture surprised me and why I’m making this one of my takeaways.</p>

                <h2>Major Takeaway #2: There are less reporters than I expected.</h2>
                <p>I was surprised to see that there were a lot less reporters than I thought there would be in a news organization. Maybe it’s because some of the news organizations like Washington Post and New York Times have only recently moved offices to Seoul, or maybe it’s because a lot of reporters were out on the field when we toured the offices. I don’t really know the specific number I was expecting, but definitely more than 10. I understand the case for Bloomberg because they told us that they have 330 offices. Washington Post has six offices in America and hubs in London and Seoul. However, the Seoul office said that they have 6 reporters working at their office (with 8 other staff), but they are also responsible for covering news from all over the world during their time zone shift. Even if they did focus mainly on Breaking News, which I’m guessing is shorter than other kinds of news articles, I still imagined that there would be a need for more manpower to create work that would be published by a reputable news organization. The New York Times office seemed like they had more staff, but it still wasn’t as much as I had thought. But they did say that the New York office was like the “Death Star” compared to their “cozy” Seoul office, so I’m guessing that the smaller number of staff is purposefully just to fulfill the duties of the time zone shift. Since I also just took a summer class on freelancing, I wonder how much of their articles are from freelancers.</p>

                <h2>Major Takeaway #3: Technology is developing very rapidly in Korea.</h2>
                <p>This is less of a takeaway and more of an observation that I wanted to point out.</p>
                <p>Seoul is now known to be one of the most high-tech cities in the world because of all the rapid economic developments of Korea in the past few decades. South Korea is a leading player in several industries, including electronics, automobiles, steel, and shipbuilding, and they are leading innovation in so many other technologies and digital spaces. But we learned that chaebols take up most of the market. Even the marketing and ad agencies of the top chaebols take up 80% of the ad market, as we learned from Wunderman Thompson. Although the chaebols played the central role in making Korea into one of the world’s largest economies, I am a little worried about how their near monopoly will continue in the future, especially now that there have been more scandals and political corruption revealed in recent years.</p>
                <p>On another note, since a lot of Korea’s economic success is relatively recent, I am also worried about whether Korea will put in the resources into making sure that regulations are put into place. The FCC was founded in 1934 and KSCS founded in 2008, but I believe America and South Korea are now on the same level of technological innovation. There has been so much debate and concern on regulations of AI or lack thereof in America. Since Korea models much of their systems after systems in America, and the fact that South Korea’s development is relatively newer, I hope that Korea will be more active in their regulations.</p>

                <h2>Major Takeaway #4: There are more politics in Korean broadcast than I expected.</h2>
                <p>I was very shocked to hear that the president of KBS was elected by the president of South Korea. This really brought into question the unbiasedness and objectivity of their content.  KBS, MBC, and SBS are the three major national networks that dominate Korea’s broadcasting industry. I wonder if the presidents of MBC and SBS are also elected by the president of Korea. However, KBS is the biggest and most trusted media brand in Korea, so even though the politics are involved when it comes to the president, I feel like they try their very best to not be very affected. I said “try their best” because I know that political corruption in the Korean government is more prevalent than you would think. The biggest corruption scandal I can think of off the top of my head right now is the scandal with the former president Park Geun-hye. With the amount of power and money at the hands of the government and chaebols, there cannot not be any corruption and bias. In the future, I guess I’ll have to take any news on Korean politics with a grain of salt.</p>

                <h2>Major Takeaway #5: You choose the company, not the company chooses you.</h2>
                <p>I mentioned this in my post-program entry, but I feel like this was the most important lesson that I learned throughout the program.</p>
                <p>I remember the guy from the New York Times saying that you have to love the process, not just the end result, if you want to be happy and successful in what you do. In terms of the newsroom, he said that you have to love meeting and talking to people, you have to love asking questions and diving in deep, you have to love writing even if your piece may get rejected. Although I am not planning to be a reporter, his words could relate to anybody thinking about what they want to do. I’ve always placed priority on trying to get a job in a big corporation, and it didn’t matter what I did there, as long as I had the big name on my resume. But doing what you want to do and also enjoying the process of getting to where you want to be was something that I learned that day. Even in (BankSalad) Dana’s case, I would consider being a senior art director in Innocean to be the greatest success, and it really is a great accomplishment. But she admitted that the job came with a lot of responsibility and stress that put a toll on her health. This made me realize that my values have been influenced by societal views. The position that society perceives as “successful” is not always something that is the best for me. Of course, that kind of a position may be my perfect dream job, but I have to be prepared for it and love the process of getting there.</p>
                <p>Since I have yet to get any corporate experience, I never thought about how important it was to work with a company that has similar values as myself and can help me achieve my goals. Visiting all the different companies during this program and asking questions made me aware that each company has their unique personality, if that’s the right word for it. Each company clearly had different atmospheres and upholds different values. Knowing that now, I can apply it to my future job search. By finding companies with similar values as me or positions that can help build my career, I know that I am in control of my own future and I want to do something that I know I will love even the process too. </p>
